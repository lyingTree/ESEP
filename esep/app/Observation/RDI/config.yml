  WA:

    description: 'LJ0 tells the ADCP to reduce receiver gain by 40 dB. This may

    description: 'The ADCP collects data over a variable number of depth cells.
    LS sets the size of each cell in vertical centimeters. If you set LS to a
    value less than its minimum value or greater than its maximum value, the
    ADCP will accept the entry, but uses the appropriate minimum or maximum
    value. For example, if you enter LS1 for a 300kHz system, the ADCP uses a
    value of 20 cm for LS. Similarly, if you enter LS5000 for a 600kHz system,
    the ADCP uses a value of 800 cm for the LS command.'

    filter that determines bottom detection. Reducing LZ increases the
    bottom-track detection range, but also may increase the possibility of
    false bottom detections.\n The LZ command also sets the minimum threshold
    for good bottom-track data. The ADCP flags as bad any bottom-track data
    with a correlation magnitude less than this value. A count value of 255 is
    a perfect correlation (i.e. solid target).'

    description: 'When setting to No Sleep(0), the instrument remains awake

    When setting to Sleep(1), the instrument sleeps between pings (or
    synchronization pulses.) There are limitations to using the Sleep Mode.
    A TRDI WorkHorse ADCP, setup as a slave, can only synchronize to within 2.5
    ms of the Master. When the Slave is in No Sleep Mode, the slave can ping to

    description: 'the amount of time a slave will wait to hear a synch pulse

    ping according to the CF, TP, TE, WP, and BP command settings. This is a
    fail-safe mechanism designed to allow the slave to proceed on its own
    should communications with the master ADCP fail. Setting ST = 0 tells the
    slave to wait indefinitely.'

  SW:

    long_name: 'The amount of time to wait after sending the pulse'
    units: 'milliseconds'
    description: 'When a Master attempts to ping a slave ADCP, it sends out a
    pulse to the slave ADCP. The slave ADCP has a different code path than the
    Master ADCP and thus, they will take different amounts of time to start the
    ping. By adding in the default Master Delay of 7.5 ms, the code paths are
    evened up to allow the units to start the pings at about the same time
    (typically within 100 microseconds of each other).'
